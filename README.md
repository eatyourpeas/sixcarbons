###### *Time blocks for a Medtronic insulin pump*
If you sit in clinic and fiddle with insulin pumps, it is often helpful to know a total insulin dose in a given timeblock, and you may want to increase or reduce that by 10 or 20%. Sometimes there are too many timeblocks and it would be helpful to see what it would look like if some blocks were merged. This tool allows you to experiment with different insulin schedules, look at the totals (per kg if necessary), before programming the pump for real.
